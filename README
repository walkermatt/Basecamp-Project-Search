A simple Greasemonkey script to add a search box to Basecamp project pages.

May need updating to reflect the address that you access Basecamp from.

Requires [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) and [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/) (as Greasemonkey is a Firefox add-on).

### To-do

* Add keyboard short cut to focus the search input
* Avoid creating any additional global variables by wrapping in a self-invoking function
